# KKday+ Travel Assistant

KKday+ is a personal travel assistant that helps you find the best traveling packages. 

Our inspiration came from an existing application "KKday", it it one the most important apps when you go on a travel, but while using it, we found that

it didn't provide a user-friendly filter engine for users. Users of KKday would have to browse through tons of packages that didn't meet their requrirement while searhcing for an ideal package. Based on the above finding, we offered the KKday+ travel assistant that offers the supplemental information including currency exchange rate, weather, national threat level, and air condition for you to prepare your trip in advance. 

It is a python project using tkinter as the GUI.

It was a group project created in the "Programming for Business Computing course at National Taiwan University". Special thanks to my teammates @junglewill, @19n, @elenahung, @rivalli, and @b05106012, they were very supportive and without them, this project would not have been built.
